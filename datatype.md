# java script has three type of data type
* primitive : string , numbers , boolean
* composite data types : Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are 
* special data type : Undefined and Null 

# primitive data type:

 * The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
 * This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing. 
 
# composite data types :
 * The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
 * An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.

# The Array Data Type

* An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.

 # The Function Data Type
 * The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables.
 * In fact, functions can be used at any place any other value can be used. Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and arrays. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, and functions can be returned from functions.
